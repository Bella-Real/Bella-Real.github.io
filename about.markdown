As an _aspiring cybersecurity professional_, I created this site to document my learning and to share tips and tricks along the way. 

Iâ€™ll be sharing the ins and outs of learning different security principles and tools from a beginnerâ€™s perspective and how I overcome challenges. I will also be sharing the projects I'm working on here to consolidate my work into a digital portfolio.

My goal is to provide a resource that other beginners with an interest in cybersecurity can reference on their journey.  There is already plenty of wonderful information out there, but it's not always from a beginner's perspective so I hope that I can add to the community in that way.

I just recently became __Network+__ certified, and am currently studying for CompTIA's __Security+__ certification. In addition to the certs, I'm hoping to get some hands-on projects under my belt so stay tuned for those!

Thank you for stopping by my little corner of the internet! I appreciate you reading all of this. Feel free to stick around for the journey.
